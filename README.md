# comp-560
assignment 1 for comp560

In this repository, go to the "src" folder and then go to the "ColorMapofUS" folder and then you'll see my code in the "Main" class folder and the "Node" class folder.


To run my code from the command line, I had a "git" directory that stored my comp assignment from when I pushed my project from eclipse to github. From the command line, I did "cd git", then I did "cd comp560", then "cd amania_assignment1Comp560", then "cd src", and then I compiled the program by doing "javac ColorMapofUS/Main.java". Finally, I ran my program by doing "java -cp . ColorMapofUS.Main" and got the output from this.


So in short, to run the program:

1. Download the project in this repository by going to the green scroll down bar (on the right side)
2. Download the file as a zip
3. unzip the file (if you're using mac, you can unzip the file by simply clicking on the zipped file)
4. take note where the unzipped file is located on your computer
5. Open up terminal
6. Go to the location of the unzipped file, changing directories as needed, until you get to the src file
7. Once in the src file, compile the program by doing "javac ColorMapofUS/Main.java"
8. After you compile the program, run it by doing "java -cp . ColorMapofUS.Main"

Note: On my computer, the code only runs when I follow the steps in the first paragraph of this README file. Otherwise, it'll give me a "FileNotFoundException".
